Been playing a bit with HTML 5 and the ''canvas'' tag.  Using some JavaScript wizardry it's possible to have an interactive Mandelbrot and Julia set explorer, with no other code.  All that's left is to add a zoom function :P

[Take a look at the Mandelbrot and Julia set generator using HTML 5 canvas element in action](https://mbharris.co.uk/fractals/mandlebrot-set-and-julia-set-explorer-in-html5.html).

There's also an [archive of old Fractal work I did with Dan Grace back in the Eighties](https://mbharris.co.uk/fe3/).  This program, called the Fractal Engine, was a Mandlebrot and Julia set explorer written in GFA Basic for the Atari ST.
